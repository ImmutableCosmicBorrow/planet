# Welcome to ImmutableCosmicBorrow's planet!
This is our contribution for the Advanced Programming course (AY 2025/2026) at University of Trento.
For the full context and course details, please refer to the [common organization repository](https://github.com/unitn-ap-2025).

## The Planet
Our planet serves as a sanctuary where explorers can safely rest and focus on crafting complex resources. We provide a robust environment featuring:
- **Rocket Crafting**: Build rockets to successfully evade incoming Asteroids.
- **Infinite Carbon**: Generate unlimited quantities of Carbon, the fundamental building block for advanced resources.
- **Unrestricted Combination**: We support the crafting of every possible resource combination.

## Smart Power Management
A core feature of our project is the implementation of an intelligent power regulation system.

The user can choose between two operating modes:
- **Random Mode**: EnergyCell consumption is determined stochastically
- **Adaptive Mode**: EnergyCell usage dynamically adjusts based on incoming messages. The algorithm prioritizes recent signals, ensuring robust planetary defense during attacks and maximizing resource prosperity when the threat level is low.
